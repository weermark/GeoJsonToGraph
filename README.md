# GeoJSONToGraph

A GeoJSON file contain points, and the info that which point connect to it.

This project try to turn GeoJSON to a graph, and implement shortest path (I use dijkstra in this project).

## api

Change to another GeoJSON file in JsonToGraph(), and give two point coordinates in dijkstra(), it will show the point on path and distance along the path.
